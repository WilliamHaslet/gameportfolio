                        Oblation is an occult themed hide and seek game made using Unity and C# for the Ludum Dare game jam. I led a team of three with one 
                        artist and two programmers, one of which was myself. As the team leader, I managed the teamâ€™s collective design choices, allocated tasks among team members, 
                        and cut many features that were out of scope for a 48-hour project. As a programmer, I was responsible for programming the player character controller, programming 
                        the interactive elements of houses, and programming the UI. As a designer, I was responsible for bringing 3D models into the engine, designing the 
                        layout of AI patrol patterns, and building the village setting with assets from the artist.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text floatRight">
                        I was a relatively new game developer at the time of this project, so jumping into a fast-paced project was both difficult and rewarding. 
                        The 48-hour time constraint meant there were many difficult choices to made about what content and features to cut. One cut feature was the ability to 
                        fight the guards, which was out of scope and a bad design choice because it would have diminished the threat that the guards pose. Since this was my 
                        first experience developing a game with a team and leading it, 
                        I got firsthand experience allocating and working on parallel tasks and managing their integration with other feature to form the final product.
